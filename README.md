# ID-Service
Manages authentication and authorization. For authentication this application uses a very 
simple approach. So it is the users responsibility not to insert any invalid user in the 
database.

## How it works?
For a user get authenticated the system must know the user first. There are two types of 
users: *admin* and regular *user*. An admin cannot be created by a user sign-up process.
Admin account is created on company sign-up process. There can be only one admin per company.

*Signing up a company is restricted to Realtime Location Service authority.* 

During a company sign-up process an admin account is created with an AppKey to use with the
application for all kinds of interaction. For example signing up users and getting user 
locations and metadata, etc.

# ENV file
Rename the .env.example file to .env
